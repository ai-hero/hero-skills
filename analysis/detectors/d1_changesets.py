"""D1 change sets -> .analysis/data/detectors.sqlite.

A change set is the smallest coherent unit of work: one thing a reviewer
would accept or revert on its own, together with its tests and the fixes
review asked for. It is read from the commits the work was made in, not
from main: squash merges collapse a PR to one commit whose message cannot
say how the work divided. So the unit Haiku sees is a merged PR's original
commits (ingest/pr_commits.py), each with its message and the files it
touched, and it groups them:
  - several commits can be one change set (a feature, its test, a review fix);
  - one commit can hold several change sets (unrelated changes bundled) --
    that commit is listed under each.
Main commits with no PR (direct pushes), and PRs whose head ref is gone,
are units of their own one commit. Dependabot PRs and single commits with
no body are one change set without a model call.

Tables:
  cs_units   one row per unit (PR or pushed commit): n_commits, n_sets, method
  cs_sets    one row per change set: its label and the commit shas in it
  changesets / changesets_by_commit   the older per-main-commit shape the
             question modules read; n_sets there is now the unit's count.
The earlier message-only labels are kept as changesets_msg_v1 for comparison.

Cached by sha256(PROMPT_VERSION + unit text) in cs_cache: a re-run labels only
units it hasn't seen, and bumping PROMPT_VERSION relabels everything.

A change set is the smallest coherent unit of work: one thing a reviewer would accept or
revert on its own, together with the commits that only exist to finish that thing.

Same change set:
- an implementation, its tests, its docs, and wiring it into config (feat + test + docs);
- review, self-review, lint or format fixes to something earlier in the PR.
Separate change sets:
- a problem found while building that has its own reason to exist, even if small (a
  secret leaking into logs, a different bug, an unrelated doc correction) -- with its test;
- unrelated changes bundled into one commit: list that commit under each change set.
Don't split one change by layer: UI + API + schema for one feature is one change set.
Every commit belongs to at least one change set.

Example. Commits: c1 feat(cache): read Mongo through Redis; c2 feat(cache): forward CACHE_TTL
into the stacks; c3 fix(cache): address self-review findings; c4 fix(cache): a malformed
REDIS_URL logged the Redis password; c5 test(cache): pin that scrubbing the URL keeps the reason.
Answer: [{"label": "read-through Redis cache", "commits": [1,2,3]},
         {"label": "stop logging the Redis password", "commits": [4,5]}]

Example of one commit holding several change sets. Commit: c1 feat(auth): OTP cooldown,
dev password login, and phone verification -- body: 1. 30s per-email OTP cooldown ... /
2. dev-mode password login ... / 3. phone verification ...
Answer: [{"label": "OTP cooldown", "commits": [1]}, {"label": "dev password login", "commits": [1]},
         {"label": "phone verification", "commits": [1]}]
Read each commit's body before grouping: a numbered or bulleted list of unrelated changes, or
a subject joining unrelated things with "and", is several change sets.
