"""Q19.xx / RQ-h7-021 -- How reproducible are the study's model-assigned
labels if a second classifier or rater runs the same prompts? Human/
methodology question: this repo's Haiku classifiers (d1_changesets,
d_prompt_kind) cache by content hash and log the raw model output, which
is what a second-rater re-run would diff against, but running that
second pass and scoring agreement is not done here.
