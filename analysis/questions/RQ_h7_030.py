"""Q19.xx / RQ-h7-030 -- When two independent passes count the same
history, where do totals disagree, and does the chosen fleet-wide
number hide that disagreement? sql half: compare the two passes this
repo actually has over the same events -- raw git commits vs D1's
Haiku-reclustered change sets -- per repo. The second pass is SUM(n_sets):
changesets holds one row per commit text, so counting its rows just
recounts commits and reads 1.00 everywhere.
