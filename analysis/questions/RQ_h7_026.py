across repos: lines, commits, PRs, or change sets? Methodology question
this repo has already answered by construction: D1's "change set" is the
chosen unit (see AGENTS.md's "change set as the fleet's preferred unit
of work" and NEW-A-02's size distribution). sql half: show why lines/
commits/PRs are each unstable units on this data.
