# Install the auto-approve CALLER into a target repository.
#
# Usage: ./install-auto-approve.sh [TARGET_REPO_ROOT]
#   If TARGET_REPO_ROOT is omitted, uses the current git repo's toplevel.
#
# SOURCE is the CALLER, not this repo's own .github/workflows/auto-approve.yaml.
# Point it at the logic and every target repo gets a private copy of the shared
# workflow, which then drifts — including past security fixes made here.
#
# Idempotent: if the target file already matches the source, no-op.
# An existing file is never overwritten: the new version lands beside it as
# .new and the operator decides.
#
# Exit codes are a contract — skills/init-hero/SKILL.md branches on them:
#   0  installed, or already up to date (safe to stage)
#   2  a different file exists; .new written beside it (do NOT stage)
#   3  the plugin's own source is missing (the plugin is broken)
#   1  anything else, e.g. the target filesystem rejected the write
