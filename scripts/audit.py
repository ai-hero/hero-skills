"""Compute (check x repo) results for the harness compliance DB.

Three levels, and this script owns the third:

    control  — CONTROLS.yaml. What we want complied with.
    check    — CHECKS.yaml. A checklist item testing FOR a control. One
               control has several, possibly at different scopes: a `ui`
               check and a `backend` check can both prove C-TOOLCHAIN.
    result   — computed HERE, live, per (check x repo). Never stored: a
               stored result is a copy, and copies drift.

Checks with no implemented checker report MANUAL, never PASS — a check
nothing verifies must not masquerade as one that passed. Referential
integrity is enforced on load: a check naming an unknown control, or a
control that no check tests, is a hard error.

Usage:
    scripts/audit.py                        # every repo, every check
    scripts/audit.py --repo auth            # one repo
    scripts/audit.py --control C-HEALTH     # every check under a control
    scripts/audit.py --control CI-01        # one specific check
    scripts/audit.py --md                   # markdown table
    scripts/audit.py --fail-on high         # non-zero exit for CI

Where things live: the ENGINE and a generic BASELINE register ship with
hero-skills (this file, assets/compliance/); the fleet's own OVERLAY — its
reference repos, its incident history, its known_violations — lives in the
fleet folder's register checkout, named by FLEET.md's `register:` key
(default .fleet/). The two are merged by id, overlay winning. Run inside a
fleet (any checkout below a FLEET.md) and the family is FLEET.md's rows
whose group is not `none`; run anywhere else and the family is the current
repo alone, baseline only. --fleet PATH names the fleet root explicitly.

Each repo is audited at --ref (default origin/main) in a detached worktree,
not at whatever branch the checkout sits on; --no-snapshot audits the
checkouts as they sit.
