# Install hero-skills' design-system enforcement layer into a target repository.
#
# Usage: ./install-design-system.sh [TARGET_REPO_ROOT]
#   If TARGET_REPO_ROOT is omitted, uses the current git repo's toplevel.
#
# Writes:
#   .claude/rules/design-system.md      path-scoped UI constraints
#   .claude/hooks/check-design-tokens.sh  PostToolUse token check
# and wires the hook into .claude/settings.json.
#
# Idempotent. Never overwrites a customized file: on drift it writes .new and
# exits 2 so the caller can diff and decide — same contract as
# install-auto-approve.sh.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  everything installed or already up to date
#   1  source files missing, or settings.json could not be wired
#   2  an existing file differs; .new written, caller must reconcile
